# DWD-week4
This week, we are asked to build a website that uses API in it. Since I was a kid, I am really interested in people in other countries, especially those who live in the opposite side of my location. To fulfill my childhood dream, I build a weather website of antiopode this time with 3 APIs.

## Design
I designed the first version of my website, and found it too hard to make because of the complicated layout and overlay, so I change it to a more friendly version, like the second picture. To explain what antipode is, I planned to add a hyperlink with a hover animation. Also, to make this website more challenging, I put a google map in it.

## Developing
In this project, I planned to use three APIs in my website, which is geolocation API, Openweather API and Google map API. At first, I started with the basic geolocation API, to see how I can utilize it. I took a reference from (https://www.antipodesmap.com/), to calculate the right position of antipode. Then use the position to call the openweather API. Finally, I grab the map from google map API, so as to present the map on the left.
